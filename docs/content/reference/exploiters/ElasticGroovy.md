CVE-2015-1427.

> The Groovy scripting engine in Elasticsearch before 1.3.8 and 1.4.x before 1.4.3 allows remote attackers to bypass the sandbox protection mechanism and execute arbitrary shell commands via a crafted script.

Logic is based on [Metasploit module](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/blob/12198a088132f047e0a86724bc5ebba92a73ac66/modules/exploits/multi/elasticsearch/search_groovy_script.rb).
