[MS08-067](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/security-updates/securitybulletins/2008/ms08-067) is a remote code execution vulnerability.

This exploiter is unsafe. If an exploit attempt fails, this could also lead to a crash in Svchost.exe. If the crash in Svchost.exe occurs, the Server service will be affected. That might cause system crash due to the use of buffer overflow. It's therefore **not** enabled by default.
